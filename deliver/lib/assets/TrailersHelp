Put all trailers you want to use inside a folder given by trailers_path.
There are no language versions of trailers for this moment. Uploaded trailers will be propagated on all languages.
Keep in mind that you can upload only one trailer per device.
Unlinke screenshots, device type won't be automatically recognized, so be sure to prefix trailer and trailer poster image with
proper device name, eg. ipad_filename.mov, iphone4_filename.jpg

** feature for the future ( ffmpeg not supported for now - passing poster image is required) **
If you pass timestamp in filename in format xxxx it will be used to extract frame from video and use it as poster image,
eg. ipad_0638_filename.mp4 will extract frame at 06,38sec of the trailer.
